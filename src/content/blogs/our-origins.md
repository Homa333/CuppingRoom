excerpt: 'Discover how our coffee journey began in the fertile highlands of Syangja and Kaski, where sustainability meets craftsmanship.'

Our coffee journey begins in the lush hills of **Syangja** and **Kaski**, two of Nepal’s finest coffee-growing regions.  
At around **1,200 meters above sea level**, these highlands provide the ideal mix of rich soil, cool climate, and elevation for cultivating premium **Arabica coffee**.

We work hand in hand with local farming communities, providing training, promoting sustainable agricultural practices, and ensuring fair trade. Through these collaborations, we guarantee not only the quality and traceability of our beans but also help uplift the livelihoods of the farmers who nurture them.

Each coffee cherry is **hand-picked at peak ripeness**, ensuring only the best fruit makes its way to our roastery. After harvest, cherries are processed and roasted with care to unlock their natural sweetness, aroma, and balance.

From these fertile slopes to your cup, every sip tells the story of **dedication, sustainability, and community** — a story that defines who we are at **Cupping Room**.
