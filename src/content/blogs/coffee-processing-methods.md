Coffee processing is the crucial first step in shaping the **flavor and personality** of your cup.  
At **Cupping Room**, we focus on techniques that highlight the natural character of every bean — from the moment it’s harvested until it reaches your cup.

After being **hand-picked at peak ripeness**, each cherry is sorted, pulped, and dried using methods that preserve both flavor integrity and sustainability.  
We choose the process that best brings out the distinctive notes of each lot.

### Washed Process

The fruit is removed before drying, producing **clean, bright flavors** and a lighter body — perfect for highlighting crisp acidity and floral notes.

### Natural Process

The beans are **dried inside the cherry**, developing **full-bodied and fruity** profiles with complex sweetness reminiscent of berries or wine.

### Honey Process

A hybrid of the two: we leave part of the mucilage on the bean while drying, creating a cup with **balanced sweetness, smooth texture, and depth**.

By carefully selecting and executing these processes, we ensure that every roast from Cupping Room carries not just flavor but also the **essence of its origin** — a true farm-to-cup experience.
